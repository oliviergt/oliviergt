" Highlight Word {{{
"
" This mini-plugin provides a few mappings for highlighting words temporarily.
"
" Sometimes you're looking at a hairy piece of code and would like a certain
" word or two to stand out temporarily.  You can search for it, but that only
" gives you one color of highlighting.  Now you can use <leader>N where N is
" a number from 1-6 to highlight the current word in a specific color.
